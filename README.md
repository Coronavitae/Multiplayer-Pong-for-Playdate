Features :
- AI strength selection: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Player side selection: Play on the left or right side of the "court"
- Your choice of controls: either the D-pad or the Crank
- Player vs Player: Not very practical, but hey! it's there ! Player 1 will use the D-pad, Player 2 will use the Crank
- AI vs AI: If you are curious ? 

This is my first Playdate game and my first game in the last ten years. I wanted to get a better grasp of the Lua SDK and what the Playdate could provide before starting a more personalized project.
